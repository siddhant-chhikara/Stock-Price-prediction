• Accurate stock price prediction is crucial for investors to make informed decisions. This project aims to predict stock prices using data.

• Load stock price data as a CSV file. Data is split into training and testing sets, with the date as the independent variable and stock price as the dependent variable. A linear regression model is trained on the data and used to predict stock prices. The model is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error The stock prices for five different stocks are visualized using a box plot.

• The model predicts the stock prices fairly accurately.

• Mean Absolute Error: 182

• Mean Squared Error: 4.47

• Root Mean Squared Error: 2.11
